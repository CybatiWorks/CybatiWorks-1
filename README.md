The CybatiWorks® scalable academic and professional control system cybersecurity platform enables educational institutions, industrial asset owners / operators, researchers and supporting entities to understand control system environments and cybersecurity risks.   The portable and complete training platform has been validated by hundreds of industry practitioners and educators.  The educational platform engages the participant in understanding, enumerating, exploiting and mitigating the engineering workstation, HMI, OPC, Historian, PLC/PAC/IED/R(M)TU/DCS and protocol communications.  The educational platform is encompassed by three primary components 
•	Virtualized operating systems serving as Historians, OPC Servers and HMIs; 
•	Embedded devices such as the Raspberry PI mini-kits platform and the Industrial Edition using off-the-shelf industrial components from companies such as Siemens, Rockwell, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Schneider Electric and Wago providing logic and physical I/O;
•	Low voltage, kinetic I/O models such as a traffic light, water treatment facility, and assembly line
